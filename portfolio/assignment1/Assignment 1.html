           <p style="text-align: center;"> <cite>404 Page Not Found</cite> is an aricle by Kate Wanger. Published in 2019. </p>
           
          <p style="text-align: center;"> I am created a responce to this article Giving my thoughts on her interpation of her experence on the internet.</p> 
           
           <p style="text-align: center;"> After reading <cite>404 Page Not Found</cite> by Kate Wagner, I thought it was an interesting read. Kate goes on about the old days of the internet and her experience with it and how it changed over the years. The way that this article is written, makes it feel more personal rather than talking about the history of the Internet. She talks about how the culture surrounding the internet has three phases. One is the text only phase. Two is that the Internet became more accessible. Three are post 911, dot&#150;com crash and Web 2.0. This shows how the internet as well as culture itself has changed overtime since its introduction to the modern day. </p>
               
           <p style="text-align: center;" The article also asked a question of what happens when a website or server shuts down. Many websites have been around for such a short amount of time and the Internet changes so rapidly that some websites can’t keep up with it. When the website or server is not profitable or is considered outdated, the owners either shut it down or abandon it. Some owners change their websites to make it more simplified, which can take away the handmade web design for some people. Kate mentions that this is something that will be inevitable, and if not for efforts from communities, lots will be gone forever. Kate uses an example when MySpace  getting rid Content from the user’s content without warning,<q>The emotion I felt, upon discovering that my old MySpace page was deleted (My Chemical Romance soundbite and all), but that its emo&#150;skull layout could still be found on Pimp&#150;My&#150;Profile.com, was sharp&#151;like discovering a loving card from an ex at the bottom of a junk drawer. The assumption that the attributes of Myspace were the sole domain of the tween doesn’t fit at all with the truth; many former users still care about these glittery sites because they were able to make them truly their own.</q> She also had the same experience with Blingee when it got rid of content. Unless she had backups of her posts, photos or videos, she will probably not steal those videos ever again. </p>
      
            <p style="text-align: center;" When we got to the early 2010s, the Internet started becoming more refined, and had things like Online forms, Video sharing sites, and Webcomics. A good chunk of these websites adapted to the internet and social media, some get left behind. Kate also talks about how web design has changed on computers and smartphones and how she thinks it is worse compared to what she got before. She quotes Christopher Mims and says<q> The Web wasn’t perfect, but it created a commons where people could exchange information and goods. It forced companies to build technology that was explicitly designed to be compatible with competitors’ technology.</q>Kate says that we’re more dependent on apps instead of the web because the web isn’t quick enough Is easier and faster to have users download an app rather than make one themselves. Kate thinks this takes away from creative potential in web making because she thinks that most websites nowadays prefer a more minimalist design which can make them all feel the same. She also talks about flash and not adapting itself to mobile devices and not being profitable enough led to its downfall and how possibly thousands of content was in danger of disappearing. Kate talks about her memories of flash and highlights things like games developed on flash and how flash was part of the old and how was part of the old and nostalgic Internet. Overall, this article and thinking about what web design was like back then versus now and how the old side of the Internet is slowly disappearing and without efforts from people, a portion of the Internet could be erased.      </p>
